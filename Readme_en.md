## Configuration

### ⚙️ Application Configuration File

The settings.json file contains the configuration information for this application.

Note: You can switch the configuration file by passing its name as a program argument.
Example: SAPIClip --setting my_settings.json

#### ✨ voice (Default: Auto)

Specify the name of the voice to use. When set to Auto, the application automatically selects and uses the appropriate voice for the text being read.

#### ✨ speed (Default: 1.2)

Sets the speed of the speech. This can be adjusted through the application's GUI.

#### ✨ replacements (Default: [])

Defines text replacement settings for reading aloud. Specify the target (pattern) with a regular expression and the replacement string with a normal string.

For example, to remove text within parentheses and URLs from speech, configure as follows. Multiple replacement patterns can be specified and are processed in order.

```json
    "replacements": [
        {
            "pattern": "\\(.*?\\)|（.*?）",
            "replacement": ""
        },
        {
            "pattern": "https?:\\/\\/(?:[\\w\\-\\.]+)+(?:[\\w\\.\\/\\?%&=]*)?",
            "replacement": ""
        }
    ]
```

#### ✨ preferred_voices (Default: See below)

Specifies preferred voice names for languages when the voice is set to Auto. In the default settings below, Microsoft Zira is used for English text and Microsoft Haruka for Japanese text.

If no voice is installed for the detected language, the first available voice specified here is used. For instance, if the text is in French and no French voice is available, it will attempt to use Microsoft Zira.

```json
    "preferred_voices": {
        "en": [
            "Microsoft Zira Desktop"
        ],
        "ja": [
            "Microsoft Haruka"
        ]
    }
```

## Adding Voices

Here's how to add voices in Windows 11.

1. Open Windows Settings and navigate to `Time & Language` - `Speech`.
2. Click the `Add voices` button under Manage Voices and select the language you want to install.

**Note:** After clicking the add button, changes won't be reflected immediately. There's no progress indicator during installation which might make you anxious, but just wait for a while and it will complete. The interface is a bit unfriendly in this regard.
